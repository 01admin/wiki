### Needed Changes

Wire protocol Hello package changed to:

**Hello**
[`0x00`, `p2pVersion`: `P`, `clientId`: `B`, [[`cap1`: `B_3`, `capVersion1`: `P`], [`cap2`: `B_3`, `capVersion2`: `P`], ...], `listenPort`: `P`, `nodeId`: `B_64`] First packet sent over the connection, and sent once by both sides. No other messages may be sent until a Hello is received.
* `p2pVersion` Specifies the implemented version of the P2P protocol.
* `clientId` Specifies the client software identity, as a human-readable string (e.g. "Ethereum(++)/1.0.0").
* `cap` Specifies a peer capability name as a length-3 ASCII string. Current supported capabilities are `eth`, `shh`.
* `capVersion` Specifies a peer capability version as a length-3 ASCII string. Current supported versions are 34 for `eth`, and 1 for `shh`.
* `listenPort` specifies the port that the client is listening on (on the interface that the present connection traverses). If 0 it indicates the client is not listening.
* `nodeId` is the Unique Identity of the node and specifies a 512-bit hash that identifies this node.
