# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform build by ÐΞV including **Ethereum**, _the generalised blockchain for smart contract development_, and **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_.

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally).

## Status 

### Frontier (in development)

Ethereum Frontier (aka PoC-9) is expected to launch soon! For more details on Frontier, see [Vinay Gupta's blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/03/03/ethereum-launch-process/).

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum read the [ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale) or for a more formal review the [ethereum yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [ethereum development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There are separate wikis for information relevant to the [C++](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) and [Go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki) implementations (Python and Javascript coming soon),

## Downloads
Bleeding edge PoC-9 code can be cloned from the develop branch of their git repositories:
- https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum
- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
- https://github.com/ethereum/pyethapp
