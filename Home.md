# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community-maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform build by ÐΞV including **Ethereum**, _the generalised blockchain for smart contract development_, and **Whisper**, _the private low-level datagram communication platform_.

Users signed in with GitHub can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally).

## Status 

### Proof-Of-Concept 7 (stable)
The latest stable (i.e. the clients are interoperable) release is PoC7. See below for releases. You can browse the chain using the poc7 [block explorer](http://poc-7.ethdev.com/).

### Proof-Of-Concept 8 (in development)
Currently in development, mainly the new p2p networking changes and peer selection. 

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum read the [ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and the [design rationale](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Design-Rationale) or for a more formal review the [ethereum yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [ethereum development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There is a [another wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) for information relevant to the C++ implementation.

## Downloads
Currently stable clients are available for PoC-7 (Proof of Concept VII):
- [AlethZero, eth and neth](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) (C++)
- [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases) (Go) 
- [pyeth](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/releases) (Python)

Bleeding edge PoC-8 code can be cloned from the develop branch of their git repositories:
