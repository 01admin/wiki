# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform build by ÐΞV including **Ethereum** _the generalised blockchain for smart contract development_ and **Whisper** _the private low-level datagram communication platform_.

Users signed in with Github can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally).

## Status 

### Proof-Of-Concept 6 (stable)
The latest stable (i.e. the clients are interoperable) release is PoC6. See below for releases. You can browse the chain using the poc6 [block explorer](http://poc-6.ethdev.com/).

### Proof-Of-Concept 7 (in development)
Currently in development, mainly data structure and Virtual Machine improvements. A reorganised opcode set will break old contracts though. A release of clients is scheduled for mid November [temp block explorer](http://www.ethergit.com).


## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum read the [ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) or for a more formal review the [ethereum yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [ethereum development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.

## Don't get lost
Check the [Glossary](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Glossary) and our [FAQ](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/FAQ). There is a [another wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/wiki) for information relevant to the C++ implementation.

## Downloads
Currently stable clients are available for PoC-6 (Proof of Concept #6):
- [AlethZero, eth and neth](https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum/releases) (C++)
- [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases) (Go) 
- [pyeth](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/releases) (Python)

Bleeding edge PoC-7 code can be cloned from the develop branch of their git repositories:
- https://github.com/ethereum/cpp-ethereum
- https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum
- https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum
