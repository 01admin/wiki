# Welcome to the Ethereum Wiki

This is the community maintained wiki covering all sorts of information on the next-generation peer-to-peer technology platform build by ÐΞV including Ethereum _the generalised blockchain for smart contract development_ and Whisper _the messaging platform_.

Users signed in with Github can edit and add pages using the [browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-wiki-pages-via-the-online-interface) or [locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally).

## Getting started
To get the basic concepts of Ethereum read the [ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) or for a more formal review the [ethereum yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/Paper.pdf). See the [ethereum development tutorial](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethereum-Development-Tutorial) for quick start to developing smart contracts.
