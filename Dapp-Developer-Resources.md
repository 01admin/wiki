As a Dapp developer you have three main resources which allow Dapp development.

### Main Resources

- [Web3 JavaScript API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API) - This is the main JavaScript SDK to use when you want to interact with a nodes API
- [JSON RPC API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) - This is the low level JSON RPC 2.0 interface to interface with a node. This API is used by the [Web3 JavaScript API](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API).
- [Solidity Documentation](https://ethereum.github.io/solidity/docs/home/) - Solidity is the Ethereum developed Smart Contract language, which compiles to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) opcodes.

### Other Resources:

- [Dapp using Meteor](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Dapp-using-Meteor) - This short tutorial gives an intro on how to start building a Dapp using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), and also why Meteor is a good fit for Dapps.
