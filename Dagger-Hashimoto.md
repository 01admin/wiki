Dagger Hashimoto is a proposed spec for the mining algorithm for Ethereum 1.0. Dagger Hashimoto aims to simultaneously satisfy three goals:

1. **ASIC-resistance**: the benefit from creating specialized hardware for the algorithm should be as small as possible, ideally to the point that even in an economy where ASICs have been developed the speedup us sufficiently small that it is still marginally profitable for users on ordinary computers to mine with spare CPU power.
2. **Light client verifiability**: a block should be relatively efficiently verifiable by a light client.
3. **Full chain storage**: mining should require ownership of the complete blockchain state.

Dagger Hashimoto builds on two key pieces of previous work:

* [Hashimoto](http://vaurum.com/hashimoto.pdf), an algorithm by Thaddeus Dryja which intends to achieve ASIC resistance by being IO-bound, ie. making memory reads the limiting factor in the mining process. The theory is that RAM is in principle inherently a much more generic ingredient than computation, and billions of dollars of research already go into optimizing it for different use cases which often involve near-random access patterns (hence "random access memory"); hence, existing RAM is likely to be moderately close to optimal for evaluating the algorithm. Hashimoto uses the blockchain as a source of data, simultaneously satisfying (1) and (3) above.
* [Dagger](http://vitalik.ca/ethereum/dagger.html), an algorithm by Vitalik Buterin which uses directed acyclic graphs to simultaneously achieve memory-hard computation but memory-easy validation. The core principle is that each individual nonce only requires a small portion of a large total data tree, and recomputing the subtree for each nonce is prohibitive for mining - hence the need to store the tree - but okay for a single nonce's worth of verification. Dagger was proven to be vulnerable to shared memory hardware acceleration [by Sergio Lerner](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2014/01/17/ethereum-dagger-pow-is-flawed/) and was then dropped in favor of other avenues of research.

Approaches that were tried between Dagger and Dagger Hashimoto but were abandoned include:

* "Blockchain-based proof of work" - a proof of work function that involved running contracts on the blockchain. The approach was abandoned because it was long-range attack vulnerabilities, since attackers can create forks and populate them with contracts that they have a secret fast "trapdoor" execution mechanism for.
* "Random circuit" - a proof of work function that involved generating a new program every 1000 nonces - essentially, choosing a new hash function each time, faster than even FPGAs can reconfigure. The approach was temporarily put aside because it was difficult to see what mechanism one can use to generate random programs that would be general enough so that specialization gains would be low; however, it is still quite viable in theory.
