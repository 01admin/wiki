Transferring funds between third-party accounts, especially those of exchanges, places considerable burden on the user and is error prone, due to the way in which deposits are identified to the client account. This problem was tackled by the existing banking industry through having a common code known as *IBAN*. This code amalgamated the institution and client account along with a error-detection mechanism practically eliminating trivial errors and providing considerable convenience for the user. Unfortunately, this is a heavily regulated and centralised service accessible only to large, well-established institutions. This protocol may be viewed is a decentralised version of it suitable for any institutions containing funds on the Ethereum system.
